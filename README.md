Spree Weight Based Shipping Calculator
======================================

Inspired by https://github.com/jurgis/spree-additional-calculators

Determine shipping cost based on total items' weight. The minimum weight is always zero and maximum weight is always
infinite. You can specify any number of weights between the minimum and maximum, and each weight, including zero weight, will have a corresponding
shipping cost. The shipping cost of an order is determined by comparing the list of shipping weight against the order's
weight - First, find the lowest shipping weight in the list that is greater than or equal to the order weight, its corresponding shipping
cost is the shipping cost of the order. For example, here is the list of weights and its shipping cost configuration:

```
Weight(lb)      Shipping Cost
   0.0              $5.0
   5.0              $10.0
   20.0             $15.0
```
and here is the shipping cost for the following orders:
```
Order weight(lb)        Shipping Cost
    3.0                     $5.0
    4.99                    $5.0
    5.0                     $10.0
    5.1                     $10.0
    9.2                     $10.0
    19.99                   $10.0
    20                      $15.0
    29                      $15.0
    50                      $15.0
    90                      $15.0
```
